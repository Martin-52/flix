### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

While making the custom MovieCell, I was unable to get the cell to display any of the data from the API. After reviewing my code, 
I realized the class and identifier name for the cell was different than the identifier I used to grab the cell in the MovieViewController
class.
